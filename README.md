# Hey, I'm Vidit 👋

I'm a high school senior interested in **AI, computer vision, and shipping production grade products**.

I primarily do research in image segmentation (did research on a CV model and beat UNC Chapel Hill's state-of-the-art SimpleClick on multiple metrics at UC Davis COSMOS) and build agentic AI apps at hackathons.

## 🚀 Projects

**Multishot:** Desktop app that runs multiple Claude AI agents in parallel for coding tasks.
